Money Convertor Class
Converts money formatted as a double "0.00" and converts it to coins through the most optimal way
Added pennies and made sure to keep the double input formatted as money by the user correctly
Added the ability to exchange coins for different coins as well as go again so the program doesn't end and thus doesn't need to be reset
